# pyTinyLetter2Kindle.py
# A simple python script that checks a gmail account for a new tinyletter.com newsletter and sends to a Kindle device.
# 
# Checks a gmail account for the latest unseen email message on the approved senders list.
# Grabs the body of the newsletter, adds a few html tags.
# Creates a file and delivers as an email attachment to the Kindle email address.
# Note that the file is not deleted.
#
# This was a coffee break script to push my tiny newsletter subscriptions to Kindle.
# There is no error checking.
# Run the script via crontab as often as you require.
# It should just work if you change a few personal settings for your gmail account.
# I have absolutely no idea if this will work on a different email provider.
# This script is supplied without any warranty whatsoever, in the hope that it will be useful.
